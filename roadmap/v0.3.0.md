## v0.3.0

### Core Focus: SQL Backend + Team Features

**Compute:**
- Expr wrapper for SQL generation
- DuckDBEngine backend
- Ability to choose engine per feature or globally

**Storage:**
- GCS storage backend (if requested)
- Feature versioning (keep history of materializations)

**Team Workflows:**
- Feature registry (central catalog of all features across projects)
- Feature dependencies (feature A depends on feature B)
- Lineage tracking (which source -> which features)

**CLI:**
- `mlforge serve` - local API server for feature retrieval
- `mlforge diff` - show what changed since last build
- `mlforge validate` - check definitions without building

**Quality:**
- Data validation on materialize (null checks, schema validation)
- Alerts/warnings for data quality issues
