I'll help you create a comprehensive project checklist for MLForge. Let me first establish standards for what makes an effective checklist for data, ML, and software projects, then apply those standards to create your detailed checklist.

## Standards for Effective Project Checklists

### Core Principles for Data/ML/Software Project Checklists

#### 1. **Structure & Organization**
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Group related tasks under clear categories and phases
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with foundational tasks, build towards complex features
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clearly indicate which tasks block others
- **Atomic Tasks**: Each item should be a single, verifiable action (not compound tasks)
- **Measurable Completion**: Each item should have clear "done" criteria

#### 2. **Specificity & Clarity**
- **Action-Oriented Language**: Start with verbs (Create, Implement, Test, Document)
- **File/Module References**: Include specific file paths and module names
- **Technical Details**: Include key technical decisions (libraries, patterns, approaches)
- **Success Criteria**: Define what "complete" means for each item
- **Time Estimates**: Include rough effort estimates (hours/days)

#### 3. **Coverage Areas**
- **Setup & Infrastructure**: Environment, dependencies, tooling
- **Core Implementation**: Business logic, data processing, algorithms
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E, performance tests
- **Documentation**: Code docs, API docs, user guides, architecture decisions
- **CI/CD**: Build, test automation, deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Logging, metrics, alerts, dashboards
- **Security & Compliance**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance**: Optimization, benchmarking, scalability testing

#### 4. **Development Workflow Support**
- **Checkpoints**: Regular milestones for progress assessment
- **Rollback Points**: Identify safe states for reverting if needed
- **Review Gates**: Points requiring code review or stakeholder approval
- **Integration Points**: Where components need to work together
- **Risk Markers**: Flag high-risk or complex items

#### 5. **Maintenance & Evolution**
- **Version Markers**: Track which version introduces features
- **Migration Notes**: Document breaking changes and upgrade paths
- **Deprecation Tracking**: Mark items scheduled for removal
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish metrics for regression detection
